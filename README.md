Is a personal project based on udemy course : [Complete React Developer Zero to Mastery by Andrei and Yihua.](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/)
This project is still on going as I'm learning from the course aside from my main job as a Front End Developer with React.
I do this project not only just to add project to my portfolio but also to strengthen my fundamentals about React and Front End Development.

To start the project, run :

```npm run start```
